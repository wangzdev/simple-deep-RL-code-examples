# About
During my learning journey of Deep RL, I find it's always helpful to look at the code snippets 

to understand the concept. Here are some, but not comprenhensive, examples of deep RL. Hope you'll 

find it useful.


# install dependencies
here is how to install depencencies for DDQN_atari_space_invaders in google's colab:
!pip install "gymnasium[atari]"
!pip install "autorom[accept-rom-license]"

if it still fails,check if the python version is too high .In my case ,I use python=3.10

## if you want to use the trained model to play game and record game video
pip install numpy matplotlib imageio imageio-ffmpeg moviepy jupyter notebook

the .ipynb file shows how do this
